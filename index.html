        <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
        <p>My journey into the world of cybersecurity is unique and diverse. I started my career working in various warehouse positions, where I honed my attention to detail, organizational skills, and ability to work under pressure. Simultaneously, I pursued my passion for music, navigating the complexities of the music industry. While I enjoyed these experiences, I always had a deep interest in technology and its potential to solve problems and create secure environments.</p>
        <p>This curiosity led me to enroll in the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate course. This comprehensive program equipped me with fundamental knowledge and practical skills. As I delved deeper into the course, I found myself drawn to the dynamic and challenging world of cybersecurity. Initially, I aimed to become a SOC analyst, but as I learned more about red teaming and offensive security, I realized that these areas matched my personality and drive perfectly.</p>
        <p>My motivation is fueled by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to constantly improve my skills. I am willing to learn anything and everything about ethical hacking and penetration testing. The ever-evolving nature of cybersecurity means there is always something new to learn, ensuring I am never bored. Transitioning from warehouses and the music industry to cybersecurity has been a challenging yet rewarding journey. My diverse background has given me a unique perspective and set of skills that I bring to my role as a cybersecurity professional.</p>
        <p>My journey is driven by a self-motivated commitment to learning and adapting. I am passionate about using my skills to protect and secure digital environments, and I am excited about the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in the field of cybersecurity.</p>
